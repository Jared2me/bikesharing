Bike sharing data analysis of a months worth of Citibike data in NYC

##Overview
The scope of this project was to visualize a months worth of Citibike data in New York City to see if it would be useful for a similar program in Des Moines. The first step was to convert the raw data (tripduration) from an integer into a datetime datatype. This would allow the data to be more easily visualized in Tableau and creating a storyboard that could be translated to success in Des Moines.

##Results
The result of the data analysis and visualization is located [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/NYCCitybikeData/Story1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
